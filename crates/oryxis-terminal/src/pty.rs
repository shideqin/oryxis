/// exit signal would fire with nothing, and the pane would read a live
/// shell as exited. The child lends its raw handle instead, valid for
/// as long as the child is (it stays the child's to close), and the
/// wait, the exit code and the kill all go straight to the kernel with
/// no duplication in the way. Same cadence as unix: a bounded wait, then
/// a look at the kill channel.
