//! The device store: `~/.oryxis/device.json`, what belongs to this
//! MACHINE rather than to any vault.
//!
//! Two things live here, both readable with every vault locked:
//!
//! - the vault REGISTRY (which vault files this device knows, the one
//!   the app opens first). Today it holds the one vault every install
//!   has, `vault.db`; multi-vault adds rows.
//! - the DEVICE SETTINGS: the few settings a process or a machine can
//!   only have one of (the UI language, the window geometry, the
//!   renderer, the folders and programs on this disk, the agent socket,
//!   the shortcut table). [`DEVICE_KEYS`] and [`DEVICE_PREFIXES`] are the
//!   one authority on which keys those are; every other setting belongs
//!   to a vault.
//!
//! **The routing is inside `VaultStore`.** `get_setting`, `set_setting`,
//! `list_settings` and `delete_settings_with_prefix` send a device key
//! here when the store has a device store attached, so the hundreds of
//! call sites that read and write settings by key keep doing so and
//! cannot pick the wrong side. `VaultStore::open` attaches the store
//! INSTALLED for the process ([`install`], called once by the app at
//! startup, before the first open); a process that installs none (the
//! MCP server, every test binary) keeps reading the vault's own rows.
//! Tests attach explicitly (`VaultStore::attach_device`) and NEVER
//! install: a test binary runs its tests in one process, and an
//! installed store would route every other test's settings into one
//! shared file.
//!
//! **Read-through.** Every read stats the file and re-reads it when it
//! changed (another process wrote it) or vanished (the harness wipes the
//! sandbox between tests while the process lives on); a missing file
//! reads as a fresh device, so nothing a previous run cached survives a
//! wipe. Writes are read-modify-write under an OS lock on
//! `device.json.lock`, temp + rename, so two processes (a second launch
//! on Linux / macOS) never lose each other's keys.
//!
//! **Migration.** The device keys used to be rows in the vault's own
//! `settings` table. [`DeviceStore::seed_from_first_vault`] copies them
//! ONCE, read-only, from the first vault, filling only keys the device
//! store does not hold yet, and marks the store seeded only after a read
//! that succeeded (a vault that does not open today, the rebuild's
//! patient, is read on the next start). The rows stay in the vault: a
//! downgraded build still finds them.
