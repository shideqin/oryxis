//! What a highlight rule does when it matches (C6).
//!
//! The scan happens in the terminal crate; this is the half that acts.
//! Three actions, in ascending order of how much they can do: a
//! notification, a beep, and typing a stored snippet into the session.
//!
//! Only the third one is dangerous, and it is dangerous in a specific
//! way: the thing that decides whether it fires is text printed by the
//! REMOTE HOST. Without a guard, any server that can write to the
//! terminal could pick which of your snippets runs on it. So a snippet
//! action asks once per rule per session, refusals are remembered, and
//! the confirmation names the rule, the snippet and the line that
//! matched, because the user has to be able to tell an expected trigger
//! from output that just showed up.
