//! Renaming a downloaded CJK font's family, in memory, to the name the
//! text stack's per-script fallback actually asks for (issue #189).
//!
//! cosmic-text picks a font for a codepoint the primary family can't
//! draw by walking a hard-coded list of family NAMES per script. For
//! Han that list holds exactly one entry per locale, and on Unix it is
//! `Noto Sans CJK SC` (macOS asks for `PingFang SC`, Windows for its
//! own). The files we download from Google Fonts are named
//! `Noto Sans SC` / `TC` / `JP` / `KR`, a different family, so they are
//! never on that list: they are only reachable through the sweep over
//! every remaining face, ordered by distance from the requested weight,
//! where they lose to anything the system has. Worse, the variable
//! fonts declare `usWeightClass = 100` (their default instance is Thin),
//! which puts them 300 to 600 units away from every weight the UI asks
//! for.
//!
//! The visible result on a machine with no `Noto Sans CJK SC` installed
//! is that one Chinese word gets its characters from whatever fonts
//! happen to cover them: measured here, `恢复默认` came back as three
//! glyphs from a JAPANESE face plus one from Unifont, and asking for
//! Bold reshuffled the list into a fourth font. A face that has a
//! codepoint in its `cmap` but no outline behind it then renders as a
//! blank at full width, which is what issue #189 reported as "truncated"
//! text.
//!
//! So the bytes are rewritten before they reach `iced::font::load`:
//! family becomes the name the fallback asks for, and `usWeightClass`
//! becomes 400 so the face sorts as an ordinary Regular. The claim is
//! honest, not a squat: Noto Sans SC IS the Simplified Chinese subset of
//! Noto Sans CJK, so a machine reading `Noto Sans CJK SC` off our file
//! gets the typeface it asked for. Where the system really has the CJK
//! family installed the two faces share it and the system's exact weight
//! match wins, which is fine because that machine already rendered
//! correctly. We only win where the named family is missing, which is
//! exactly the case that was broken.
//!
//! Two things this deliberately does NOT do. It never touches the cached
//! FILE: `fonts::is_language_cached` validates the cache by byte length
//! against the pinned `len`, so a renamed file on disk would fail that
//! test forever and re-download on every boot. And it is wired only into
//! the CJK path, never into the terminal font pack, whose picker
//! resolves families by the name the user sees.
//!
//! Known limitation, recorded rather than worked around: the fallback
//! list is keyed by the SYSTEM locale, not by the app's language. A
//! Japanese UI on an `en-US` machine asks for the Simplified Chinese
//! family for its kanji, and the `...JP` file we registered is not
//! consulted. Registering one file under several names would double an
//! 18 MB face in the font database for a case where the glyphs are
//! shared anyway.
