//! Password-suggest popup: offer a stored credential at a password
//! prompt (issue #117, Termius parity).
//!
//! The detector is [`oryxis_terminal::prompt_detect`], fed off the grid
//! once per output batch. This module owns everything after that: which
//! credentials are worth offering, when a popup may open at all, the
//! keyboard contract, and the injection.
//!
//! Three rules the whole design hangs on:
//!
//! - **Nothing is ever sent without a pick.** The popup is a
//!   suggestion. Enter with nothing selected still belongs to the
//!   prompt, so a user who typed their password by hand is never
//!   interrupted.
//! - **No plaintext in app state.** Entries carry the vault row to read
//!   from, never the credential. The decrypt happens on the pick and
//!   the buffer is scrubbed after the write.
//! - **Never over a login script.** A `LoginScript` run exists to
//!   answer exactly these prompts (issue #122). Offering the user a
//!   second credential for a prompt the runner is already answering
//!   would put two secrets on one PTY.
