//! `Oryxis::handle_port_forwards`, match arms for the standalone port
//! forward entity: CRUD on `PortForwardRule`, and the runtime on/off
//! toggle. Every forward to one host rides a single shared PTY-less SSH
//! connection (`PfHostConn`, issue #126): the first rule dials, later
//! rules attach as channels, and the connection closes when the host's
//! last forward stops.
//!
//! Kept separate from `dispatch_ssh.rs` (terminal sessions) so the two
//! lifecycles don't tangle. Turning a rule off drops its
//! `ForwardSession`, which cancels only that rule's tunnel.

// Domain handlers return `Err(Message)` to pass an unclaimed message
// back up the chain. See the note in `dispatch_ssh.rs`.
