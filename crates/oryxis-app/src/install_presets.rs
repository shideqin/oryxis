//! Built-in install scripts (issue #147): the one-time host setups our
//! own docs walk through by hand, shipped as editable snippet presets.
//!
//! Every preset is a self-contained POSIX script the USER fires from
//! the snippets surfaces; the app never types into a shell or writes a
//! dotfile on its own (the standing rule since the OSC 7 injection was
//! removed). An install snippet's Run always parks the careful-paste
//! confirmation first, so the full body is on screen before a byte is
//! sent.
//!
//! The scripts are built around the SAME resource files the docs quote
//! (`resources/shell-integration.sh`, `resources/osc7.sh`, both pinned
//! to their doc by test), wrapped in an idempotent installer: write the
//! file under `~/.config/oryxis/`, add the rc line only when absent.
//! The shell-integration preset keeps the `__ORYXIS_NONCE__`
//! placeholder in its body; the snippet injection path substitutes the
//! vault's CURRENT key at run time, so rotating the key never leaves a
//! stale copy of it inside the preset.
//!
//! Preset ids are FIXED (not random): two devices of one sync group
//! each seeding their own vault mint the same rows, so the pair
//! converges to one copy instead of duplicating. The seeded timestamps
//! are fixed and old for the same reason: a user's later edit (or
//! delete) always carries the newer timestamp and wins the LWW merge,
//! so seeding on a second device can never resurrect what the first
//! one changed.
