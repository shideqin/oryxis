//! The vaults this process has open, and which one a piece of code is
//! working on.
//!
//! Several vaults may be open at once, and every window works on one of
//! them (`MULTI_VAULT_SPEC.md`): the window carries the vault's id
//! (`ExtraWindow::vault`, and for the window whose values are in the
//! fields, [`VaultSlots::current_id`]), and reads and writes that vault
//! here. Vault data never moves: a view is built with `&self`, so it
//! could not be swapped into the fields for the window being drawn the
//! way `enter_window` swaps a window's own values in `update`.
//!
//! [`VaultSlots::cur`] is the one way to read a vault and resolves "the
//! vault of the window acting now": during a view pass, the window being
//! drawn (`window_ctx::viewed_vault`); otherwise the window whose values
//! are in the fields (the resident one, or the window `update_in_window`
//! entered). [`VaultSlots::cur_mut`] is the `update`-only way to change
//! it. The fields are private, so no code can reach a vault around the
//! resolution and read another window's.
