//! More than one window, one application.
//!
//! The app is an iced daemon: one process, one `Oryxis`, any number of
//! windows, and to the user none of them is special. Each is a whole
//! window: its own strip of tabs, its own screen (the hosts list, a
//! vault view, a tab), its own place in those screens. What they share
//! is everything that is the APP's: the vault and its data, the
//! settings, every session.
//!
//! Nothing about a tab lives in a window: every `TerminalTab` stays in
//! `Oryxis::tabs`, with its session, scrollback and panes, and a window
//! only says which of them it shows and in what order. Moving a tab
//! between windows therefore moves an id between two lists, and the
//! session never notices.
//!
//! What IS per window is small: the strip order, the active tab, the
//! view, the vault navigation ([`WindowNav`]), the size, the cursor, the
//! maximized / fullscreen flags. One window, the RESIDENT one, keeps
//! those in the `Oryxis` fields they always lived in; that is a storage
//! detail, not a role, and when the resident window closes another is
//! promoted into the fields ([`Oryxis::promote_window`]). Every other
//! window keeps its own copy in [`ExtraWindow`], and reaches the code
//! that reads those fields in two ways:
//!
//! - `update`: a message that comes from a window arrives as
//!   `Message::InWindow(id, ..)`, and [`Oryxis::update_in_window`] SWAPS
//!   that window's values into the fields for the duration, so every
//!   handler acts on "the active tab", "the strip" and "the view" of
//!   the window the user is in without knowing there is more than one.
//! - `view`: built from `&self`, where nothing can be swapped, so the
//!   window being drawn is ambient ([`viewing`]) and the views read the
//!   per-window values through the `cur_*` accessors below. During
//!   `update` nothing is being drawn and the accessors return the
//!   fields, which is what makes them safe to use anywhere.
//!
//! Things that exist ONCE are drawn in one window: a menu, a modal or a
//! drag in the window it was raised from (`float_window`), a side panel
//! in the window it was opened in (`panel_window`), a panel tab
//! (Settings) in the strip of the window that last asked for it.
