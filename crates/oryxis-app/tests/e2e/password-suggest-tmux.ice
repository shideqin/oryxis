# Issue #232: the password popup inside tmux. The multiplexer lives on
# the alternate screen, where the prompt shares its row with the pane
# beside it and the screen may belong to an editor instead, so the
# detector cuts the row at tmux's divider and only accepts the exact
# shapes programs print. The setup is password-suggest.ice's.
#
# The tmux socket lives inside the sandbox (TMUX_TMPDIR), which the
# runner wipes per test, and `-f /dev/null` keeps a runner's own
# config out of the layout.
#
# Setup is coordinate-driven because none of it is text-selectable: a
# key must exist before the keychain toolbar (and its "+ ADD" split
# button) renders at all, and the identity form's fields are
# text_inputs, whose placeholders the text selector cannot match.

# The "+ ADD" chevron. The screenshot before it is not decoration: menus
