# E3, the relay wizard's second level: "Install on one of your hosts"
# lives inside the wizard card in Settings > Sync, reads the wizard's
# domain / token, and refuses to probe without a host. The host picker
# is a real modal (Esc closes it, the keyboard walks it) shared with the
# SFTP snapshot transport, and a probe against a host whose key is not
# known is REFUSED with the hint that names the way out, because the
# dial is unattended (strict host key, no prompt).
#
# What this cannot cover: the consent modal and the run need a probe
# to succeed, which needs a real Linux host with systemd and a
# published `relay.json`; that is the out-of-tree integration script.
#
# Tall viewport on purpose: the wizard card sits below the fold of the
# Sync page and the emulator's wheel does not reach the settings
# scrollable.
