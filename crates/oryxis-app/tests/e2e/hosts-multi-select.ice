# Multi-select mode (issue #230): a toolbar toggle turns a card click
# into a selection, the bar over the grid carries the batch, a picked
# card's right-click menu collapses to what acts on the whole
# selection, and the batch delete asks first and names what goes.
#
# The mode toggle is an icon-only square, so there is no text for a
# selector to match and it is clicked by position. At 1400x900 the
# toolbar cluster is anchored to the right edge: the "+ HOST" split
# group (92 + 1 + 40 px) ends 25px in from that edge, and the toggle's
# 44px square sits one 8px gap and its own 6px leading gap to the left
# of it, which puts the square's centre at x 1212 on the cluster's own
# centre line (y 121). Every click below is followed by an assertion
# that only the intended control could satisfy, so a cluster that
# changes shape fails at the click rather than three steps later.
#
# What the mode does is asserted in text: the count, the bar's labels,
# and the menu's labels. A card's check box is a drawn glyph and a
# card's label is real text, which is why the count is the evidence
# for "this many are picked" rather than the boxes.

# Three hosts to have a batch out of. The first goes through the
# first-run empty state - Continue submits its empty field, which
# opens the editor (the same path hosts-move-to-group.ice uses); the
# other two through the toolbar's "+ HOST". The editor's label field is
# reached by position for the toggle's reason: a text_input value is
# invisible to a selector, so there is nothing else to click.
