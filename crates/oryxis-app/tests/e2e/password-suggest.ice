# Issue #117: a pane blocking on a password prompt offers the
# credentials the vault holds, at the caret, and never sends one on its
# own.
#
# `read -s -p` is the fixture rather than `sudo`: it prints the exact
# prompt with echo off and blocks, which is the whole shape the
# detector keys on, without needing a privileged binary on the CI box.
# The last section takes the same shell into tmux (issue #232), which
# used to be a file of its own with this same setup in front of it.
#
# Setup is coordinate-driven because none of it is text-selectable: a
# key must exist before the keychain toolbar (and its "+ ADD" split
# button) renders at all, and the identity form's fields are
# text_inputs, whose placeholders the text selector cannot match.

# the `read`, the shell prompt returns) must close the popup on the

# session recording.

# 6. A prompt on the LAST terminal row (where a shell prompt lives,
# so this is the ordinary case) opens the popup ABOVE the caret. The
# clamp alone only slid the box up until its bottom met the window's,
# which both clipped the hint line off and covered the prompt line the
# user is answering.
#
# The click coordinate IS the assertion here: it lands on the row only
# where the flipped box draws it (the clamped placement put that row
# ~80 px lower, on top of the prompt itself). Text selectors cannot
# read a clipped box, so the exact geometry is asserted in the unit
# tests next to `popover_y`; this covers it end to end. It depends on
# the vault holding exactly ONE credential (the row sits at y=640 only
# in a 96 px popup): a second one would move the rows and this click
# would send the wrong password while still reading as a pass.

# 7. Inside tmux (issue #232). The multiplexer lives on the alternate
# screen, where the prompt shares its row with the pane beside it and
# the screen may belong to an editor instead, so the detector cuts the
# row at tmux's divider and only accepts the exact shapes programs
# print. The tmux socket lives inside the sandbox (TMUX_TMPDIR), which
# the runner wipes per test, and `-f /dev/null` keeps a runner's own
# config out of the layout.

# 7a. Split tmux left / right. The left pane prints words that would
# both carry and exclude a match if the row were read from column 0.
