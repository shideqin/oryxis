# Issue #225 follow-up: a touchpad pinch over a pane zooms the terminal
# font as the Ctrl+wheel chord it is on Windows, so the "Zoom with Ctrl
# + wheel" switch covers it. `pinch <delta>` replays one whole gesture
# (start, one move, end), and the widget fires ONE step per event that
# completes one (a real trackpad delivers a gesture as dozens of small
# moves), so three gestures of 0.12 are three steps of `PINCH_STEP`
# (0.1), each leaving a remainder the end phase discards. The zoom is a
# session delta over the preference, so the stepper still reads 14 and
# the line under it says 17.
#
# `timeout 800` once the local shell is open: the live PTY keeps the
# zen emulator from ever quiescing. The pinch lands at (600, 400), the
# middle of the lone pane; the gesture has no position of its own, the
# cursor is what "over this pane" means. (92, 20) is the strip's "+"
# with no tab open, (56, 20) its Home button, (150, 20) the shell's chip
# and (370, 20) the Settings chip once both are open (the active shell chip is the wide one).
