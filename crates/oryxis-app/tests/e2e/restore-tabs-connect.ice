# Issue #229: the two asks a restored strip can make beyond coming
# back. Both rows live under "Restore last session's tabs" and only
# exist while it is on, so the test turns it on first, the way
# restore-tabs-on-launch.ice does (same reveal, same toggler
# coordinate; re-measure both together after a layout change).
#
# First half: "Open on the tab that was active" with the default
# "connect when selected". After the restart the app is NOT on Hosts
# (that is the text-level proof), and the select the landing performed
# is what connected the shell, exactly as a click on the chip would.
#
# Second half: "connect at launch" with the landing off. The app opens
# on Hosts as it always did, and the shell was dialled IN PLACE while
# it sat there: the screenshot shows the placeholder's own hint with
# the dial marker and the prompt below it, which the foreground reopen
# (a fresh tab) never produces. Canvas only, so the picture is the
# record.
#
# A local shell is the only session a headless run can open with no
# host. `reset` keeps the sandbox vault, so the rows written as the
# strip changed are what the restart reads.
