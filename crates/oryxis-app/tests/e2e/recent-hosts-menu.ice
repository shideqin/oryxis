# Issue #206, the recency half: the tab popovers offer the hosts most
# recently connected, so reaching one again is not a trip through the
# picker.
#
# The list is `Connection.last_used`, which the tray submenu and the
# Windows JumpList already read and which nothing wrote until now, so
# what this really covers is the feed: the stamp is taken at the TOP of
# the connect switch, above the protocol split, which is why a dial that
# never resolves still counts as having used the host.
#
# `db.invalid` is deliberate. The stamp does not wait for the dial, so
# the outcome is irrelevant, and an address that CANNOT resolve fails in
# milliseconds instead of parking the run on a host-key prompt from
# whatever happens to be listening on the machine running the test.
#
# The label is long on purpose: the popover cuts one at 24 characters,
# so the row reads `prod-database-primary-e…`, a string that appears
# nowhere else in the frame. The chip and the progress card both carry
# the full label, and a shorter one would make every assertion here
# match all three.
