# Issue #266: typing at a prompt offers the commands run before on that
# host, under the line. The popup is the password popup's shape over
# text: Down engages, Enter completes the line, Shift+Enter completes
# and runs, Esc hides it for the rest of the line, and nothing is ever
# typed without a pick.
#
# The history is per saved host, so the fixture is a saved host with the
# Local protocol and no terminal picked (the default shell): a
# `PaneOrigin::Host` that opens without a server. The protocol pick
# list's options are not text-selectable, so the Local row is clicked by
# coordinates (screenshot `hist-protocol-menu` is where they were read).
#
# Two sections. The first runs on the harness bash as it comes (no OSC
# 133 marks): the classic-prompt heuristic reads the echoed line. The
# second gives bash the four marks (PS1 + DEBUG trap, as
# terminal-copy-last-command.ice does) so the prompt's own B mark places
# the line, and proves the completion RAN through "Copy Last Command +
# Output", whose clipboard is the command and its output exactly.

#    Command + Output" (unbound, so through the palette) proves exactly.
