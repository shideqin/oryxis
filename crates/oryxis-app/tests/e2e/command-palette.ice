# every hotkey (plus hosts / Settings sections / a few extras). The
# rows, the title pill and the empty state are real text widgets, so
# the assertions ride those (the activated terminal canvas is not
# text-selectable, hence the final step is a screenshot). `timeout
# 500` only after a live shell opens: the zen emulator never quiesces
# with a running PTY.
