//! Guards Cargo.lock resolution invariants that cargo cannot express.
//!
//! `gpu-allocator 0.28` accepts `windows >=0.58,<=0.62`, a range that
//! spans semver-incompatible majors, so a full re-resolution is free
//! to unify it onto any other `windows` major the lock happens to
//! carry (0.61 came in through notify-rust's Windows backend until
//! that moved to 0.62). wgpu-hal 30 compiles its DX12 suballocator
//! against `windows 0.62` types, so that unification breaks the
//! Windows build (ID3D12Device / D3D12_RESOURCE_DESC mismatches),
//! and only on Windows, which local Linux gates never see. It has
//! happened twice (fixed in 155a572, regressed by a lock refresh on
//! 2026-07-10); this test makes the third time a red test run
//! instead of a broken nightly.
//!
//! Reading the resolved version is two cases, and missing the second
//! one silently broke this guard once already: Cargo puts a version on
//! a dependency line ONLY when the package name is ambiguous. While the
//! lock carried several `windows` majors the edge read
//! `windows 0.62.2`; once the family was unified to one version the
//! same edge became a bare `windows`, the `starts_with("windows ")`
//! lookup found nothing, and the test failed claiming gpu-allocator had
//! no `windows` dependency at all. Both spellings mean the same thing
//! and both have to resolve.
//!
//! The second invariant is the `windows-sys` line. The lock carries two
//! of them and only the newest is compiled into a release build: the
//! older one is held by a package that asks for it exactly and is
//! never compiled (see `PINNED_TO_OLD_WINDOWS_SYS`).
//! Many other packages accept a range that spans both (`errno` and
//! `rustix` take `>=0.52, <0.62`), so for them the lock's edge is a
//! preference and nothing more, and any pass of the resolver, a
//! `cargo update -p <anything>` included, is free to move them onto the
//! older line. Every gate stays green when that happens; the Windows
//! build just compiles `windows-sys` twice from then on.
