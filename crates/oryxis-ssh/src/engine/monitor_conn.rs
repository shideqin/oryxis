//! Headless, probe-only connection for the multi-host monitor
//! dashboard (issue #95).
//!
//! A [`MonitorConn`] is the authenticated transport and nothing else:
//! no PTY, no shell channel, no reader/writer tasks. The host sees a
//! login and one short-lived exec channel per poll, exactly like the
//! per-session monitor's side channels, so an idle dashboard entry
//! costs the server nothing but a TCP connection. Hosts with a live
//! terminal tab never go through here (the dashboard reuses the tab's
//! [`SshSession`](super::SshSession) instead).
